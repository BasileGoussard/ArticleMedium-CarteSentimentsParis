# ParisMap

Thanks to those four jupyter notebook you can 

- Download data from instram
- Preprocess your data to keep only those which are in a certain location
- Apply sentiment analyse to your data
- Merge the location and the sentiment analysis

Moreover I add the map of paris with the sentiment analysis score and all the posts that I used to calculate this score.
